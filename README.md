Chaos Engineering is the principle of finding weaknesses in distributed systems by testing real-world outage scenarios on production systems, or as close to production as is possible. 
In a more abstract sense, Chaos Engineering is a strategy to learn about how your system behaves by conducting experiments to test for a reaction.

Chaos Engineering is more than fault injection, such as introducing latency or errors. 
While fault injection is an important component when conducting experiments, it is limited in scope to testing one condition.
Chaos Engineering can be used for other situations, such as large traffic spikes, byzantine failures, race conditions, and other unpredictable circumstances, that could lead to service outages.
The goal of Chaos Engineering is to generate new information about how systems as a whole react when individual components fail.
